Hi, Iâ€™m Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

At [KNIME](https://www.knime.com), I had the chance to work on research applications using AI and Machine Learning, e.g. [Does body size matter in Triathlon?](https://www.knime.com/blog/does-body-size-matter-in-triathlon) or applying [Open Source Vision Models](https://www.knime.com/blog/ai-in-sports-analytics-object-detection) for object detection and tracking in soccer. 

My master's [thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eVe5mFt36n26ADedGGOQgyazaaOQSimQ/view) at [ETH Zurich's LRE Lab](https://lre.inf.ethz.ch) explored the effectiveness of Large Language Models for predicting prerequisite networks in textbooks. 

I've been fortunate to win several AI/ML ETH competitions, including challenges in [Hate Speech Detection](https://latsis2023.ethz.ch/program.html), [Arts Creation with LLMs Prompting](https://www.datathon.ai), and [Soccer Analytics](https://sn.ethz.ch/hs23/sasc.html) using ML approaches. 

During my studies, I deepened my understanding of NLP through coursework and collaborative research, which led to workshop publications at top-tier NLP conferences, including [EMNLP 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.case-1.11.pdf), [CLEF 2022](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3180/paper-86.pdf), and [COLING 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.vardial-1.10.pdf).
