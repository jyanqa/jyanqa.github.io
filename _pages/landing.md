Hi, I'm Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

The main reason I started writing my personal website is to project something of the real me into virtual life. As AI continues to build more and more personalities, I want to leave my footprint in this evolution. Second, with AI developing so quickly, I'm starting to blog to share my thoughts about things and take notes on this rapid pace of change.
