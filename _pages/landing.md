Hi, I'm Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I started this site to project something of the real me into virtual life. As AI evolves rapidly, leaving a personal footprint in this evolution might be something everyone should consider, especially before virtual individuals are massively produced. 

Also, as a junior, I use this space to take notes to take note of AI, especially breakthroughs in foundation models, along with broader perspectives on alignment, AGI, ethics, and the economic impact of AI.
