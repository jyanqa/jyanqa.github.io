Hi, I'm Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

The main reason I started writing my personal website is to project something of the real me into virtual life. As AI continues to build more and more personalities, I want to leave my footprint in this evolution. Second, with AI developing so quickly, I'm starting to blog to share my thoughts about things and <span style="color: #008080">take notes to take note</span> on this rapid pace of change.

I'm interested in making myself more updated with what people are chatting about, but I also don't want to hastily catch the wave. I mainly take note of what I think is fundamental in the long run while staying aware of what and why people in the field are discussing. A few topics I'm interested in are breakthroughs in foundation models in AI, scaling time, reinforcement learning, datasets and benchmark; as well as some personal views about alignment, AGI, ethics, and the potential impact of AI to economy.
