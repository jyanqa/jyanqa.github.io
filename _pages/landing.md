Hi, I'm Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Currently working at [KNIME](https://www.knime.com) on AI and Machine Learning research applications.

I've been fortunate to win several AI/ML competitions at ETH Zurich, including challenges in [Hate Speech Detection](https://latsis2023.ethz.ch/program.html), [Arts Creation with LLMs](https://www.datathon.ai), and [Soccer Analytics](https://sn.ethz.ch/hs23/sasc.html).
