Hi, I'm Anh

I started this site to project something of the real me into virtual life. As AI evolves rapidly, leaving a personal footprint in this evolution might be something everyone should consider, especially before virtual individuals are massively produced. 

Also, as a junior, I use this space to [take notes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_notes#English) and [take note](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/take_note) of AI, especially breakthroughs in foundation models, along with broader perspectives on alignment, ethics, and the economic impact of AI.
