Hi, I'm Anh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science graduate with a focus on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I started this site to project something of the real me into virtual life. As AI evolves rapidly, leaving a personal footprint in this evolution might be something everyone should consider, especially before virtual individuals are massively produced. More importantly, as a junior in the field, I use this space to take notes and keep up with the rapid pace of change.

My notes focus on core developments like breakthroughs in foundation models, scaling, and reinforcement learning, along with broader perspectives on alignment, AGI, ethics, and the economic impact of AI.
