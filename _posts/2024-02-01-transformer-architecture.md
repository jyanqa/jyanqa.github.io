The transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing since its introduction in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. This post explores the key components of transformers, from self-attention mechanisms to positional encodings, and how they enable the remarkable capabilities of models like BERT and GPT.

Key topics covered:
- Self-attention mechanism
- Multi-head attention
- Position-wise feed-forward networks
- Layer normalization
- Positional encodings

Stay tuned for a deep dive into each component and their interactions.
